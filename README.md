# Chat-Game

Version 0.0.0
script.js + videochat.html:  Agora Web-SDK for video conferencing

Games:
1. draw.html + sketch.js + server.js: multiplayer drawing game, developed via P5js & socket.io
2. game.html: copied from the embedded game code (iframe src) of a webgame
3. some other games: directly embeb their website in our website

Issues:
1. some webbrowsers (safari, firefox) doesn't show the remote videos, neither send out video stream
2. remote video container is too large
3. we want the video conferencing container float above the game and draggable
4. how to deploy the project into a server so that both mainland Chinese and kids in the US could access

2. a multiplayer video game that kids could decorate their house
